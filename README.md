## Data nerd looking to get more into the coding world...

My educational background is economics, which led to Bayesian statistics, which led to ... if you know, you know.

Currently working on a portfolio to show off my skills. Also, trying to build those skills. Current goals:
- grabbing data with APIs
- getting my Linux machine to talk to others
- moving deeper into Python for data cleaning, graphics, etc
- R Shiny, Tidy*, etc
- Speak and write German at a C1 level

Any questions, comments, suggestions, or complaints, feel free to reach out!
