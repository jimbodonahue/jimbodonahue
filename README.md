## Data nerd getting more into the coding world...

My educational background is economics, which led to Bayesian statistics, which led to a deep dive into statistical models that continues to this day.

Currently working on a portfolio to show off my skills. Also, trying to build those skills. Current goals:
- Grabbing data with APIs
- Getting my Linux machine to talk to others
- Moving deeper into Python for data cleaning, graphics, etc
- Geospatial analysis
- Speaking and writing German at a C1 level

Any questions, comments, suggestions, or complaints, feel free to reach out!
